Description: 

Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.

The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.

If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.

Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.

Solution: 

2 edgs cases: 

1. when pivot index is at 0, and the sum of the right part is eqaul to 0. `Return 0` 
2. when pivot index is at right most which is nums.length-1, and the sum of the left part is equal to 0. `Return nums.length-1`

General: 

Based on different pivot indexex, in a while loop (the condition is loop from the second element to the last one), use 2 for loops to calculate the sum
of the first part and the last part. THe first and the last mean the sum of the elements before and after the pivot index.

public int pivotIndex(int[] nums) {

        int total = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i<nums.length; i++) {
        
            total += nums[i];
            
        }
        
        if ((total - nums[0]) == 0) {
        
            return 0;
            
        } else {
        
            int pivot = 1;
            
            int first = 0; //store the sum before the pivot
            
            int last = 0; // store the sum after the pivot
            
            while (pivot < nums.length-1) {
            
                for (int i = 0; i<pivot; i++) {
                
                    first += nums[i];
                    
                }
                
                for (int j = pivot+1; j<nums.length; j++) {
                
                    last += nums[j];
                    
                }
                
                if (first == last) {
                
                    return pivot;
                    
                } else {
                
                    first = 0;
                    
                    last = 0;
                    
                    pivot++;
                    
                }
                
            }
            
        }
        
        if ((total - nums[nums.length-1]) == 0) return nums.length-1;
        
        return -1;
}

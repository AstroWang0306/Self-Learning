Description:

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Solution:

There are two ways. The first one will be done by iteration. The second one can be done by recursion. 

1. Iteration: Create a new linked list, compare the elements from list1 and list2. When value of list1 is samller than value of list2, store it 
 into the new list. Let list1 = list1.next so it can compare list1.next.val and list2.val. By comparing all of the elements from list1 and list2,
 we get a new sorted ListNode. However, the length of the two lists can be different. There may be some left elements in either list1 or list2. Based on the problem description, we know the value of the nodes can be increasing or remain the same. We just have to append the left nodes to the sorted one. 
 Here, we use ternary (conditional) operator to append the non-null list. 
 
 ```
 //Iteration
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
        ListNode head = dummy;
        ListNode tmp = head;
        while (list1 != null && list2 != null) {
            if (list1.val <= list2.val) {
                head.next = list1;
                list1 = list1.next;
            } else {
                head.next = list2;
                list2 = list2.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        head.next = (list1 != null) ? list1 : list2;
        return tmp.next;
    }
}
```

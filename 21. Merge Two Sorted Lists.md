Description:

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example:

Solution:

There are two ways. The first one will be done by iteration. The second one can be done by recursion. 

1. Iteration: Create a new linked list, compare the elements from list1 and list2. When value of list1 is samller than value of list2, store it 
 into the new list. Let list1 = list1.next so it can compare list1.next.val and list2.val. By comparing all of the elements from list1 and list2,
 we get a new sorted ListNode. However, the length of the two lists can be different. There may be some left elements in either list1 or list2. Based on the problem description, we know the value of the nodes can be increasing or remain the same. We just have to append the left nodes to the sorted one. 
 Here, we use ternary (conditional) operator to append the non-null list. 
 
 ```
 //Iteration
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
        ListNode head = dummy;
        ListNode tmp = head;
        while (list1 != null && list2 != null) {
            if (list1.val <= list2.val) {
                head.next = list1;
                list1 = list1.next;
            } else {
                head.next = list2;
                list2 = list2.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        head.next = (list1 != null) ? list1 : list2;
        return tmp.next;
    }
}
```

2. Recursion: This is similar to iteration. However, it takes much less codes. The base condition is when list1 and list2 are null. And the callinf stack is like below. For example, list1=[1,3] and list2=[1,2]. In order not not to be confused, list1 = A list2 = B. According to the code, 

```
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
       if(list1==null) return list2;
        if(list2==null) return list1;
        
        if(list1.val<=list2.val){
            list1.next = mergeTwoLists(list1.next,list2);
        } else {
            return mergeTwoLists(list2,list1);
        }
        
        return list1;
    }
}
```

We can list thge layer:

| Layer     | condition                   |Return Value                 |
|--- | -------------- | ------------------------ |  
| Layer1 |A.val(1) <= B.val(1)        |A.next = merge(A.next, B)     |
|Layer2  |A.next.val(3) > B.val(1)    |merge(B, A.next)              |
|Layer3  |B.val(1) <= A.next.val(3)   |B.next = merge(B.next, A.next)|
|Layer4  |B.next = null               |return B, which is list2c     |

Finally, we got all of the method in the calling stack. Based on the law of the stack, `Last in First Out`, which means the last method should be dealed first. 

A ---> B---> B.nxt---> A.nxt---> B.nxt.nxt(null)

B.nxt.nxt was the last returned value. The order is reverse.

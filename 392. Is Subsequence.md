Description:

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Solution:

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int arr[] = new int[s.length()];
        int tmp = 0; //store the previous index of the char
        for (int i = 0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            if (i == 0) {
                if (t.indexOf(s.charAt(i)) == -1) {
                    return false;
                } else {
                    tmp = t.indexOf(s.charAt(i));
                }
            } else {
              if (t.indexOf(s.charAt(i), tmp+1) == -1) {
                  return false;
              } else {
                  tmp = t.indexOf(s.charAt(i), tmp+1);
              }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Important method used in this solution: `indexOf(char)` or `indexOf(char, fromIndex)`

The first one can search the char in the whole string, if there are repeated chars, it will return the first inddex

The second one can seach the char start from the fromIndex, and else is same as above.

If there is no such char in the string, both of them will return -1.

Notes:

Use the string s as base, iterate each char through the string s. if the return. value is -1, return false. Otherwise, use the returned index to be

the new fromIndex.
